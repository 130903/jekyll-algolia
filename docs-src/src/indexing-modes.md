# Indexing modes

Several ways to skin a cat, so show different ways of indexing. We want to be
mindful of people quotas. 

- atomic: push everything to a new index
- diff: pushes the difference
- atomic-diff: Makes a copy of the current index, then do a diff on it, and
  replace it

Show pros and cons of each
