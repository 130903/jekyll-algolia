# Algolia Jekyll Plugin

Jekyll plugin to automatically index your Jekyll posts and pages into an
Algolia index by simply running `jekyll algolia push`.

## Installation

First, add the `algoliasearch-jekyll` gem to your `Gemfile`, in the
`:jekyll_plugins` section. If you do not yet have a `Gemfile`, here is the
minimum content to get your started.

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '>=2.5.3'

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'algoliasearch-jekyll'
end
```

Once this is done, download all dependencies with `bundle install`. 

Then, add `algoliasearch-jekyll` to your `_config.yml` file, under the `gems`
section, like this:

```yaml
gems:
  - algoliasearch-jekyll
```

If everything went well, you should be able to execute `jekyll help` and see the
`algolia` subcommand listed.

## Configuration

Add information about your Algolia configuration into the `_config.yml` file,
under the `algolia` section, like this:

```yaml
algolia:
  application_id: 'your_application_id'
  index_name:     'your_index_name'
```

You admin api key will be read from the `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` environment variable.
You can define it on the same line as your command, allowing you to type
`ALGOLIA_API_KEY='your_admin_api_key' jekyll algolia push`.

### ⚠ Other, unsecure, method ⚠

You can also store your admin api key in a file named `_algolia_api_key`, in
your source directory. If you do this we __very, very, very strongly__ encourage
you to make sure the file is not tracked in your versioning system.

## Usage

```shell
$ jekyll algolia push
```

This will push the content of your jekyll website to your Algolia index.

You can specify any option you would normally pass to `jekyll build`, like
`--config`, `--source`, `--destination`, etc.

## Searching

This plugin will only index your data in your Algolia index. Adding search
capabilities is quite easy. You can follow [our tutorials][1] or use our forked
version of the popular [Hyde theme][2].

## GitHub Pages

Unfortunatly, GitHub does not allow custom plugins to be run on GitHub Pages.
This mean that you will have to manually run `jekyll algolia push` before
pushing your content to GitHub.
