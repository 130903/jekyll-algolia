## I want to report a bug:

**What is the current behavior?**

**What is your expected behavior?**

**Steps to reproduce the issue:**
<!-- If you have a repo we can clone to try, or a screenshot, that is even
better! --> 

## I want to suggest a feature:

**What is your use case for such a feature?**
<!-- The more you can tell us about WHY you want to do this, the easier is will be for us to tell you HOW to do it. -->

**What is your proposed API? Is this a new option? A new behavior?**
